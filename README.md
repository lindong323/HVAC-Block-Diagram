### Updated Steps to Add the Revised Diagram

1. **Go to Your Repository:**
   - Navigate to your GitHub account and open the repository where you want to add the file.

2. **Create or Edit the README.md File:**
   - If you haven't already created a `README.md` file, click on the "Add file" button, select "Create new file", and name it `README.md`.
   - If the file already exists, click on the `README.md` file in your repository and then click on the pencil icon (✏️) to edit it.

3. **Add the Updated Mermaid Diagram Code:**
   - Replace or add the following Markdown content to include the updated diagram:

         D --> E[Condenser System]
         E --> F[Refrigerant Circuit]
         F --> G[Economizer]
         G --> H[Purge System]
         H --> I[Control System]
     ```
     ```

4. **Commit the Changes:**
   - Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section.
   - Enter a commit message, for example, "Add functional system block diagram".
   - Choose whether to commit directly to the `main` branch or to create a new branch (for simplicity, commit directly to the `main` branch).
   - Click "Commit new file" or "Commit changes".

5. **View the Diagram:**
   - After committing the changes, navigate to your repository's main page.
   - You should see the rendered Mermaid diagram in the `README.md` file.

By following these steps, you can create and maintain an updated block diagram of the water-cooled chiller functional system directly in your GitHub repository using Mermaid.
